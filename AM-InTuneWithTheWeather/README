Hi Team! 
This project is a fully running flask project which allows you to create a user, set preferences, 
login, see your preferences and log out. Functionality for spotify oAuth and the spotify player+
playlist creation and playing can easily be added to this code, but feel free to take just the parts
you like. There was a lot of javascript from the original prototype I had to convert to Python, but 
aspects like weather still need to be converted. If you have questions let me know.

To run this program you need to have installed:
python
mongodb
virtualenv

1.from the folder run a terminal
2.
(win) python -m venv env 
(mac) python3 -m venv env
3. from the code pallette search python: select interpreter and choose the python from the env folder
4.
(win)
set FLASK_APP=app.py 
set FLASK_ENV=development 
set FLASK_DEBUG=1
python -m flask run

(mac)
FLASK_APP=app.py FLASK_ENV=development flask run

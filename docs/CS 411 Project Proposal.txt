Idea One- Weather Mood Songs
Using current climate data and user preference to make a personalized playlist depending on the user’s location. For example, if the user associated sunny weather with a good mood and happiness, and it is currently sunny in the user’s location, they will be suggested a playlist with happy music. Moreover, as users will be signing into our app via their Spotify accounts, we can suggest music that they regularly listen to based on the weather. We would be utilizing a database to store user preference to more easily curate their playlist. We will also retrieve weather information and create these playlists using publicly available APIs. 


Idea Two- Food Allergy Recipes
Use publicly available datasets to help put together recipes for people with dietary restrictions and give them nearby restaurants with the same dietary restriction. Users can input their dietary restriction needs along with any other preferences for food into a user profile that will be stored into a database to prevent the user from having to repeatedly input their preferences every time they launch the application. For example, if someone has a peanut allergy, recipes will be provided to them that do not contain peanuts, as well as restaurants in the area that are peanut-free or offer peanut-free dishes. We would be utilizing a database to store a profile of dietary restrictions.

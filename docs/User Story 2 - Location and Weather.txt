User Story 2 - Location and Weather


As a logged in user, I want to be able to have my geographical location and my location’s current weather forecast automatically detected so that I am not required to manually input my location every time upon logging in, unless I need to change my location and, consequently, weather forecast. If I am unable to have my location automatically detected, I will be given the option to input my geographical location manually through a location input form. If I can not find my exact location when inputting my information, I will be given an error message saying that my location could not be found, please try again or find the nearest location well known to me (e.g. if my city is near Seattle, WA and cannot be found, I will input Seattle,WA as my nearest location). If my current location’s weather is not accurate, I will be able to manually change my location’s weather using selections from a drop-down menu to more accurately represent what is currently happening outside.

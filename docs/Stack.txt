Stack 1: LAMP
* Linux, Apache, Mongo, Python


Stack 2: FMAP 
* Flask, Mongo, Angular, Python
* Team is more familiar with python and javascript than php and apache


Stack 3: FMP (Favored)
* Flask, Mongo, Python
* Team is more familiar with python than php, apache 
* Flask does the front end work we would need, so Angular is not neccessary

In these stacks, we are able to work on layers of the application separately. With that said, we are selecting Stack 3 for the reasons listed above.

Stack 1: LAMP
* Linux, Apache, Mongo, Python


Stack 2: FMAP (Favored)
* Flask, Mongo, Angular, Python
* Team is more familiar with python and javascript than php and apache


In both stacks, we are able to work on layers of the application separately. With that said, we are selecting Stack 2 because the team has more experience with python and javascript than with PHP and apache.

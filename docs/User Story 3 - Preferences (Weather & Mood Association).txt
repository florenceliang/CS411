User Story 3 - Preferences (Weather & Mood Association)


As a logged in user, I want to be able to manually input my mood associations with different weather conditions, so my recommended playlist will reflect my mood. If I am selecting my mood preferences for different weather, I should see a drop down menu of the mood options I can select for each potential weather condition.

I will be able to There will be an option to save all preferences after they have been selected. If I do not select and save my own preferences in my profile or complete all of the preference fields, I will get an error message that all preferences have not been selected and I will be prompted to return to my preference page or select a default mood-to-weather association (pre-set: sunny-happy, rainy-sad etc.). If my preferences change, then there will be an option to update and re-save.

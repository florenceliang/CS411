User Story 4 - Preferences (Mood & Music Association)


As a logged in user, I want to be able to manually input my genre/music associations with my different moods so that I get a playlist that reflects my mood. I want to be able to input as many genres as I want for each mood, because there are times where multiple genres can reflect my mood. If I am unable to do so, then the music I listen to might become banal if I live in a region where the weather is very stagnant. For moods I do not have a specific genre preference for, I would like a mix of songs taken from genres and songs I already listen to on Spotify to be returned. I want to also mark which genres I never listen to so that I do not get music relating to that genre in my mood playlists. If all goes right, then I should receive music from the genres that I prefer for each mood. If I get songs from a genre that I do not relate to a mood, then I can dislike the song, and it will alter my mood playlist so that I do not get similar songs (as decided by Spotify) from that genre in my playlist. The genre preference will be associated with the mood preference in User Story 3.

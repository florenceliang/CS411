#### Project Overview:
Our project suggests a Spotify playlist to the user based on current weather of a predetermined location, how the user associates weather with mood, and how the user associates mood with music.
  
In our repository, there are three designated folders:
* The "docs" folder contains our project proposal, our stack as well as our user stories (6 in total).
* The "prototype" folder contains an HTML prototype of our project, as well as supplemental pictures and files.
* The "AM-InTuneWithTheWeather" folder contains our actual project
